// From chapter 2.3 - Annotation: The Core of Active Reading - of the Electronic Book by CC Marshall

// Annotation types:

// Telegraphic marks: Underlines, circles and asterisks (for now we will focus on underlines)

// Explicit Notes: Special kind of Notes (Writing words or sentences in the margin)
/**
 * - Appears exactly where note wants to be created on web page, exactly how margin notes would appear in books
 * - Has the same properties as Notes
 */

// Header/Footer/Title Marks: Special kind of ExplicitNotes (Readers often circle chapter titles or headings to map the structure of the argument.)
/**
 * - Exhibits the same behaviour as explicit notes
 * - Mostly for titles (Heading-like elements for instance), header and footers on PageBreaks
 */

// [web]PageBreaks + Special scrollbar (TODO: Check notes for exact specification on this one)
