## Data Models

### Task Model
Tasks are the top-level organizational unit with the following properties:
- **Hierarchy**: Tasks contain subtasks, subtasks contain tabs
- **Metadata**: Total time spent, tab count, note count, last session
- **Attributes**: Title, color, priority, tags, links
- **Tracking**: Created/updated/accessed timestamps, version history
- **Metrics**: Salience score, productivity score, archive history
- **Positioning**: Graph coordinates, canvas coordinates

### Note Model
Notes capture your research insights:
- **Types**: Regular notes, clips (excerpts), annotations
- **Content**: Title, content, excerpt, tags
- **Relationships**: Linked to tasks, subtasks, tabs, other notes, files
- **Metadata**: Citations count, todo status, pinned status
- **Tracking**: Created/updated/accessed timestamps

### Tab Model
Tabs represent web pages with rich metadata:
- **Basic Info**: URL, title, favicon
- **Provenance**: Source (search, link, bookmark, direct), source URL, timestamp
- **Engagement**: Dwell history, visit count, scroll depth
- **Interactions**: Clicks, copies, searches, keystrokes
- **Metrics**: Salience score, productivity score
- **Session Data**: Chrome tab ID, group ID

### Annotation Model
Three types based on academic research (CC Marshall):
1. **Telegraphic Marks**: Highlights, underlines, circles
2. **Explicit Notes**: Margin-style notes with full content
3. **Header/Footer Marks**: Structural annotations for titles

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Storage
- **IndexedDB**: Primary storage for all data (tasks, notes, tabs, annotations, sessions)
- **Object Stores**: Separate stores for each data type
- **Event Buffering**: Session events buffered (50 events) and flushed every 5 seconds
- **Limits**: Max 10,000 session events, 500 notes per task

### Productivity Scoring Algorithm
The productivity score (0-1) is calculated based on:
- **Dwell Time** (30%): Time spent on page (capped at 30 minutes)
- **Scroll Depth** (20%): How far down the page you scrolled
- **Annotations** (30%): Number of highlights/notes created (capped at 5)
- **Notes** (30%): Number of notes created (capped at 3)

### Session Logging
Complete event tracking for session replay:
- **Event Types**: Tab open/close/switch, note created, annotation created, task created
- **Enrichment**: Viewport info, device info, browser info
- **Buffering**: Events buffered and batch-inserted to IndexedDB
- **Metadata**: Session ID, timestamps, event counts

### Synchronization
- **Cross-Component Sync**: Background ↔ Content Scripts ↔ Workspace ↔ Word Add-in
- **Message Passing**: Chrome runtime messaging for communication
- **Broadcast Updates**: Changes propagated to all active components
- **File System Integration**: Planned for Word add-in data sharing

- **Tag liberally**: Tags make notes searchable and discoverable
- **Link related notes**: Build connections between ideas
- **Archive completed tasks**: Keep your workspace clean

### Maximizing Productivity Tracking
- **Let tabs dwell**: The extension tracks time automatically
- **Scroll through content**: Scroll depth indicates engagement
- **Create annotations**: Highlights and notes boost productivity scores
- **Review your metrics**: Check the dashboard to understand your patterns

### Note-Taking Strategies
- **Use clips for quotes**: Save exact text with automatic source tracking

##  FAQ

### Does this work with other browsers?
Currently, the extension is built for Chrome using Manifest V3. Support for Edge, Brave, and other Chromium-based browsers should work with minimal changes. Firefox support would require porting to their extension API.

### How is my data stored?
All data is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. Nothing is sent to external servers. The Word add-in can optionally sync via a shared folder you configure.

### Can I export my notes?
Export functionality is planned but not yet implemented. You can currently access notes via the Word add-in or directly from IndexedDB.

### What happens to my data if I uninstall?
Uninstalling the extension will remove all stored data. Make sure to export important notes before uninstalling (once export is implemented).

### Does this track my browsing history?
The extension only tracks tabs you open while it's active and only stores metadata (URL, title, time spent). It does not track browsing on excluded sites (YouTube, Gmail, etc.).

### Can I use this for collaborative research?
Currently, the extension is single-user. Collaboration features are planned for future releases.

### How does the productivity score work?
The score combines dwell time (30%), scroll depth (20%), annotations created (30%), and notes created (30%). Higher engagement = higher score.

### Is this free?
Yes, this is an open-source research project. There are no paid features or subscriptions.
